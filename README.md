# 🎮 GameSense: Data-Driven Analysis of Player Behavior in the Gaming Industry

This project presents a complete data analytics pipeline that explores player behavior using a realistic gaming dataset. It includes demographic and behavioral analysis, visual insights using Python libraries, and an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit. The goal is to uncover how player age, session habits, platforms, and regions affect gaming and spending behavior.
